Hello!

I am trying to get some easy, contained documentation system set up.

I want to do this because:
   I want my code to be useful
   It's good practice to have self-maintained projects
   (especially in the sciences where technical expertise can be minimal)
   Documentation looks professional and is good practice in general,
   even for my own pet-projects

Secondary Bias:
   A sequence trend around statistically biased residues and
   a test to see definition styling

Internal crossreferences, like example_.




This is an example crossreference target.
