Some documentation on documentation. This page will include links and instructions for Sphinx documentation
and for general documentation stuff.

Documentation using Sphinx:
---------------------------

    Full docs:

        * Sphinx full docs: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html
        * Quickstart -- installing starting: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.7/tutorial.html
            1. after completed, run make html from /sphinx dir
        * apidoc for documenting new modules: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-apidoc.html#cmdoption-sphinx-apidoc-full
            - can be run from project directory (directories defined in command)
            - should be run when new module is added
            - autodocuments docstrings in modules and associates them with source in the documentation


.. important::
   1. Always commit any new work before messing with docs and be wary of weird commit issues (i.e. reappearance
      of deleted files).
   2. ***MUST*** commit git add . and git commit from project folder
   3. The 'make html' command has to be run from the /sphinx directory
   4. 'make hmtl' makes html files from the .rst files using conf.py
